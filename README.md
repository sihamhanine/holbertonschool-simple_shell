# Simple Shell
This project creates our own version of Simple Shell. This is a group project from HolbertonSchool training
## Description
**Shell is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them. The shell, also known as a command-line interpreter, is a command-line user interface found in Unix-like operating systems. It serves as both an interactive command language and a scripting language. The shell's role is to provide a flexible and powerful way to control the system's execution, either through commands entered directly by the user or by executing shell scripts.**
