.SH NAME

.B simple_shell
- Simple Shell for Holberton School

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B ./hsh
[command] [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The simple shell (hsh) it's a simple program that contains and executes the basic functions of a shell (bash).
This shell, like the others, takes keyboard commands and delivers them to the system to be executed.
Whit this shell you can execute commands like ls for example.
.br

Shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.


.SH INVOCATION

hsh  can  be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If hsh is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.
If hsh is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by isatty(3)), an interactive shell is opened.  
When executing interactively, hsh displays the prompt "$ " when it is ready to read a command.
Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, hsh treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
The supplied file should contain one command per line.  
.br

.SH Environment

Upon invocation, hsh receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was exeucted.  
This environment is an array of name-value strings describing variables in the format NAME=VALUE.
.br

.SH Command Execution
.br
After receiving a command, split string it into words using " " as a delimiter. 
The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command.  
hsh then proceeds with the following actions:
1. If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\) nor dot (.), the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.
If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
br.
2. If the first character of the command is none of a slash (\), dot (.), nor builtin, 
hsh searches each element of the PATH  environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
br.
3. If the first character of the command is a slash (\) or dot (.) or either of the above searches was successful, 
the shell executes the named program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment.
